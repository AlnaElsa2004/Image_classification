# Image Classification Project

This project explores three approaches to image classification using neural networks. Implemented in Google Colab, the methods include:

1. **Pixel-Based Classification**: A dense neural network processes raw pixel data to classify images.
2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Convolutional layers extract spatial features to improve classification performance.
3. **Transfer Learning with Fine-Tuning**: A pre-trained model is adapted to classify images by leveraging its learned features and refining them for the specific dataset.


## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Google Colab

## Descriptions of Methods

1. **Pixel-Based Classification**:
   - The input images are flattened into 1D arrays of pixel values and fed into a fully connected neural network.
   - This approach uses simple patterns but lacks the ability to learn complex spatial relationships, often resulting in lower accuracy.

2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**:
   - CNNs use convolutional layers to detect spatial hierarchies of features, such as edges, textures, and shapes.
   - This approach learns complex visual patterns, significantly improving accuracy compared to pixel-based classification.

3. **Transfer Learning with Fine-Tuning**:
   - A pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet or VGG16) is used as the base model to leverage features learned from large datasets.
   - Fine-tuning involves unfreezing some layers of the pre-trained model to adapt its feature extraction to the specific dataset.

## Results

In this project, the **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** outperformed both pixel-based classification and transfer learning in terms of accuracy. The CNN effectively learned dataset-specific features, achieving the best classification results.

However, it is important to note that performance may vary depending on the dataset. For datasets with limited training samples, transfer learning with fine-tuning might provide better results by leveraging pre-trained features.

## How to Use

1. Open the notebooks in the `Notebooks` folder in Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions in each notebook to run the models.
3. Review the classification reports for detailed performance metrics.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the progression of image classification methods, showing how advanced techniques like CNNs and transfer learning outperform basic approaches like pixel-based classification.
